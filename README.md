# Capstone_project---1
This project was developed using data collected from Federal database about 76000 different colleges and students in the United States described using 1800 feartures. I used this to analyze the variables that effect salary of a student after 10 years of  graduation. I have used Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. Also, pipeline was generated to Grid Search for hyperparameters, perform cross validation and develop Random Forest and Elastic Net models. 

The latest file is Capstone_Project_Final.ipynb    
The slide deck for the whole project is Capstone_project_1_slides.pdf along with the final report Capstone_project_1_Final_report.docx
